Yes, in most interactive applications, we typically use **`Scanner`** or **`BufferedReader`** to accept user input. However, `String[] args` (command-line arguments) serve a different purpose and are useful in scenarios where **pre-execution input** is required.

---

## **Why `String[] args` is Needed?**

Command-line arguments (`args[]`) allow us to **pass values to the program before it starts executing**, without requiring interactive input.

### **Situations Where `args[]` is Useful**

1. **Automated Execution & Scripting**
    
    - Running programs without manual input.
    - Example: Running a batch of calculations without pausing for input.
2. **Configuration & Customization**
    
    - Specifying file paths, server ports, or settings when launching a program.
    - Example: Running a web server on a specific port.
        
        ```
        java WebServer 8080
        ```
        
        The program reads `args[0]` to determine the port.
3. **Competitive Programming & Testing**
    
    - Many coding competitions require input via command-line arguments.
    - Example:
        
        ```
        java Factorial 5
        ```
        
4. **Performance Optimization**
    
    - `args[]` is **faster** than `Scanner` since it doesn‚Äôt wait for input.

## **Comparison: `args[]` vs. `Scanner`**

|Feature|`args[]` (Command-Line Arguments)|`Scanner` (User Input)|
|---|---|---|
|**When Input is Given**|Before execution|During execution|
|**How Input is Passed**|From the command line|Typed by the user|
|**Best For**|Scripts, automation, batch processing|Interactive programs|
|**Requires User Interaction?**|‚ùå No|‚úÖ Yes|
|**Example Run**|`java Program 10 20`|User types input during execution|

## **When to Use Which?**

- If **interactive user input is needed** ‚Üí Use `Scanner` or `BufferedReader`.
- If **parameters should be passed at runtime automatically** ‚Üí Use `args[]`.
