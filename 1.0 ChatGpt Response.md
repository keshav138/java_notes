### **Example Prompts Based on What We Covered:**

✔ _"Explain the `this` keyword in Java with examples, use cases, and common mistakes."_

### **How to Get Even Better Responses?**

🚀 **Be Specific** → Instead of _"Explain strings in Java,"_ ask _"Compare `String`, `StringBuilder`, and `StringBuffer` with examples and performance analysis."_  
📌 **Request Code & Best Practices** → _"Give a complete example and common mistakes to avoid."_  
🔍 **Mention Format Preference** → _"Include a table comparing features."_
