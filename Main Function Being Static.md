The `main()` function in Java is **declared as static** to ensure that it can be called **without creating an instance** of the class. This is crucial for the Java program's execution because:

### **1. No Object Creation Required**

When Java starts executing a program, the **JVM does not create an instance of the class automatically**. Declaring `main()` as static allows the JVM to call it **directly using the class name**.

**Example:**

```java
public class Demo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {  // Static method
        System.out.println("Program Started");
    }
}
```

JVM calls it as:

```java
Demo.main(args);
```

If `main()` were **not static**, the JVM would need to create an object first, but since there's no constructor call mechanism at startup, execution would fail.

---

### **2. Prevents Unnecessary Object Creation**

Declaring `main()` as an instance method (`non-static`) would mean:

```java
public class Demo {
    public void main(String[] args) {  // Non-static main (incorrect)
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}
```

Here, to run `main()`, JVM would have to do:

```java
Demo obj = new Demo();
obj.main(args);
```

- This is **inefficient** because Java does not need an object just to start execution.
- It may also cause unintended side effects if the constructor has operations like database connections, file handling, etc.

---

### **3. Logical Separation of Entry Point & Objects**

Static methods belong to the **class itself** rather than an instance. Since `main()` is the **entry point** of execution, it makes sense for it to belong to the class, not an object.

- Static `main()` â†’ Can be executed by JVM without dependency on instances.
- Instance `main()` â†’ Would require object creation, making execution non-universal.

---

### **Advanced Example:**

Even though `main()` is static, it can **still create objects** if needed:

```java
public class Test {
    int value;

    Test(int val) {
        this.value = val;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test obj = new Test(10);  // Object created manually
        System.out.println("Object Value: " + obj.value);
    }
}
```

Output:

```
Object Value: 10
```

This ensures flexibility while keeping execution efficient.

---

### **Final Summary**

- `main()` is `static` so it can be called **without an object**.
- JVM can **directly call** `main()` using `ClassName.main(args)`.
- Prevents **unnecessary object creation** at program startup.
- Keeps the **entry point logically separate** from object behavior.
